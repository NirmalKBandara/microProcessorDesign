- `4-bit Nano Processor Implementation in VHDL.`

- The primary objective of this lab was to design and implement a simple 4-bit *nanoprocessor*
capable of executing a predefined set of instructions. The tasks were divided among team
members to ensure collaborative development and integration of multiple components. The
following tasks were completed as part of this lab.
